                            Rust is a language i have recently learned as of 2024. I find the language
                            to make a lot of sense to me and i thoroughly enjoy the features and concepts
                            that the language brings to the table, such as borrow checking and lifetimes.

                            I have a decent understanding of this language and am familiar with the c family syntax.
